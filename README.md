Data Science Tasks Oasis InfoByte

I'm thankful to Oasis Infobyte for providing me with this wonderful opportunity to explore the data science domain. The internship includes tasks related to data science and machine learning which was beginner-level.
The #internship duration was about a month. Where each data science enthusiast has to complete at least three tasks. Approximately one task per week. The learner needs to have basic knowledge of python, Jupyter Notebook as an editor, and machine learning algorithms.
